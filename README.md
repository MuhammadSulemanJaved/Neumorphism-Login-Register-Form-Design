# Neumorphism-Login-Register-Form-Design
Neumorphism Login/Register Form Design Using Css and Html.
First I have created the main div
main div with class"main"
placed two container divs inside it
The first container div contains sign up form fields 
other Contains Login in contents.
 I have linked CSS and JavaScript files
 
 using CSS, first I have placed all the items in the right place.
  it is not responsive. But you can create it by our own.
   I have used CSS Flex display :flex; to create the sturcture. Now box-shadow and background-color commands are responsible for neumorphic design. Also, I gave transition delay which is managed by JS.
   
   JavaScript handling here the switch functions. This is pure JS, there I have not used any JS library like jQuery or any other else. JS fetching all the elements using document.querySelector command and storing in let. There is have used JS let attribute for storing data and executing functions. Used .classList.toggle command for toggle function.
